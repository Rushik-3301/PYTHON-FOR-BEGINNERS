# ARRAYS:-
* EX:-a=[10,20,30,40,50]
* PRINT(a)
* OUTPUT->[10,20,30,40,50]
>>> ARRAY INDEX STARTS FROM ZER(0)
# SECOND EXAMPLE
* EX:-a=[10,20,30,40,50]
* a[1]=15
* PRINT(a)
* OUTPUT->[10,15,30,40,50]
# THIRD EXAMPLE
* a=[10,20,30,40,50]
* for i in a:
* print(i)
* OUTPUT->10
*         20
*         30
*         40
*         50
# CONCLUSION:-
*PRACTISE THIS AND U CAN LEARN IN ONLINE TOO BUT I WILL ALSO MAKE AND ANOTHER ONE OF PYTHIN TUTORIAL AND THANK YOU...
